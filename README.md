# Node-Electron
Electron App using JavaScript, HTML and CSS


# NOTES :

- You need to have Node js installed.
- You need to have internet connection in order to get bootstrap styling (CDN used).
- I used tutorials in the internet to creat this App.
- to run the app : "cd" into the app folder and tape: 'npm start'
