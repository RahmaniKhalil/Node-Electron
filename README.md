# Node-Electron
Electron App using JavaScript, HTML and CSS


# NOTES :

- You need to have Node js installed.
- You need to have internet connection in order to get bootstrap styling (CDN used).
- I used tutorials in the internet to creat this App.
- to run the app : "cd" into the app folder and tape: 'npm init' and create the package.json file.
  > then type : 'npm install'.
  > then type : 'npm install -g electron'.
  > then type : 'npm install electron --save' (to add it as a dependancy to the package.json file).
  > to run the App, type : 'npm start'.


Enjoy :D

Thank you...
